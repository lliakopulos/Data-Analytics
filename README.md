# R-Project

Created on 11/01/2021

The file Homework9.Rmd was created as a final review for my final exam in R Studio.
The class was mostly focused on analyzing files by creating different kinds of charts, regression (linear and multiple), the use of functions
(mean, median, mode, sd) and testing hypothesis in analytics.
